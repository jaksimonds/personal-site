This is the repo for my personal site built on NextJS using the app router and hosted on Vercel. I opted to leverage Apollo GraphQL to load in data from a custom CMS back-end site. My goal with this site is to showcase projects I've been working on as well as providing a place for me to experiment with front-end tech that I find interesting.
