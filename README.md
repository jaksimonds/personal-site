This is the repo for my personal site built on NextJS using the app router and hosted on Vercel. Originally the site leveraged Apollo GraphQL to load in data from a custom CMS back-end site as a way for me to experiment with that tooling but the overhead of managing two sites became a pain. My goal with this site is to showcase projects I've been working on as well as providing a place for me to experiment with front-end tech that I find interesting.
